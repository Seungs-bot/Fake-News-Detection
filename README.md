# BCF1 Group 6 - Fake News Detecction Repo

## Information
- Repository for SC1015 Intro to DSAI AY21/22 Sem 2 project
- Application of the Machine Learning Pipeline in the order of
 1. Data Extraction & Preparation
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
 3. Machine Learning Models
 4. Evaluation and Insights

## Team Members
- Kane Tan (Data Extraction & Preparation)
- Javier Tan (Data Visualisation & Analysis)
- Lee Seung Soo (Machine Learning)

## Problem Statement
Predicting fake news by the news title using Natural Language Processing

## Models Used
Ensemble model consisting of 5 sub-models
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naives-Bayes Classifer
3. Binary Tree Classifier
4. Passive Aggressive Classifier
5. Support Vector Machine

## Outcome 
- NLP is a good way of classifying news by the title
- High prediction accuracy of 83.5% of the ensemble model
- Good warning system for users' exposure to fake news online
- Cross-checking about the content of the news is still required
